About Us:

Hello and Welcome!

My name is Nirmala, I live in UK.

I started Indian Veg Recipes in 2018. The website is maintained my myself.
As I have done my graduation in Information Science and I am a front-end developer.


Indian Veg Recipes are home cooked food whether its making a rice or sweets. 
We believe in cooking with fresh ingridients which are easily available.
We avoid using processed food like ready made purees, spice pastes, ready to eat stuff etc in our cooking.
As a result we have sound health in our family. "Eat Healthy and Stay Healthy" is our motto.

Indian food is diverse as well as vast there is so much variety that we bet one cannot find
such a massive variety in any country. From simple everyday
recipes to complex recipes, from a basic daal to a rich biryani,
from a light meal to a full thali meal. There are thousands of 
varieties of food that one gets in India. Amd not to forget 
the sweets and deserts too, yet another indian culinary delight is the Indian 
street food.
